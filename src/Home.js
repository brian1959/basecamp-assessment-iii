        <h2>Hey DevMountain!</h2>
        <p>I spent time reading up on the react components. I have attempted not to plagerize
          anyone elses work. I am still learning how to do this right.  I worked through a tutorial
          online that showed me how to setup navigation that will let each project display independently.
          Hopefully, what is presented here is satisfactory to you.
        </p>
 
        <p>I am excited about bootcamp! See you soon.</p>
      </div>
